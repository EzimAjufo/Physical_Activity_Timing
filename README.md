# Physical_Activity_Timing
Physical Activity Timing and Risk of Future Cardiovascular Disease Analysis

# Description
Example scripts to perform analyses for the UKB Physical Activity Timing project (publication pending)

# Notes

- Scripts are posted for illustrative purposes
- Relies on presence of specified UKB fields present as separate flat files for the four diseases (please see Online Table 2 in Supplement) and exposures (please see Online Table 1 in Supplement) for details.
- The main MVPA exposure was derived from UKB derived accelerometry fields courtesy of the Oxford BDI team (see https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/18/1008)
- Script 'Activity_Timing_Distribution.R' contains the code creating the time of day variables
- Scripts in the 'cox_models_MVPAunadjusted.R' contains code for MVPA unadjusted analyses Cox models 
-  Scripts in the 'cox_models_MVPAadjusted.R' contains code for MVPA adjusted analyses Cox models
-  All UKB data utilized are available by application (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/register)
